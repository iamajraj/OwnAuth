Implemented own authentication flow like next-auth with own custom middleware but simpler and straight forward approach because I was too bored to read the next-auth documentation. [Btw ignore that sqlite.db file in the repo :)]

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
